# Burgers-Id-Like-To-Eat
A Node.js app using Express and Handlebars!

This application uses a custom-made ORM, MySQL, Node.js, and Express to create an application capable of adding new burgers to a database, and "eating" them, i.e. moving them from one html element to another by changing values within the MySQL table.
